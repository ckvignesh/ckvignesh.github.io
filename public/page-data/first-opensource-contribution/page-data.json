October is a month that has become a metaphor for Open Source thanks to Hashnode’s <em>Open Source October</em>.</p>\n<h2>You don’t need to know how to Code to get started</h2>\n<p>I’m a newbie developer who was eager to contribute to Open Source but felt it would be overwhelming. I spent most of my Uni hating code. It was only during the last year that I seriously started coding after I started a hands-on Project.</p>\n<p>I still don’t consider myself an “expert coder” though I have learnt a lot over this year.</p>\n<p>So, I’ll address the first concern you may have in mind.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do I need to know how to code, to contribute to Open Source?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Short answer - No.</p>\n<p>Open Source is not just about coding. There are documentations (like How To’s, Readme’s etc) and translations that need to be done.</p>\n<p>But, to contribute to Open Source, you must be comfortable with - Github. Because that’s where most of the OS Repositories are housed.</p>\n<h2>My First Pull Request that was merged</h2>\n<p>I was researching about Product Management, a few days ago. It’s something I’d like to do sometime later in my life. I came across a Github Repo that had a vast collection of links related to Product Management. If you’re interested, you can check it <a href=\"https://github.com/ProductHired/open-product-management\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>As I went through this, I noticed 2 links were not working. It was a broken link that was a Quora Answer by Jackie Bavaro. I noticed that one more link in the same section was not working.</p>\n<p>I first copy-pasted the headline of the Quora answer into Google to search for them, as I found it was a very interesting question. I soon found those answers and realised that the link was different. Perhaps there were some changes made by Quora that led to a new link for this content.</p>\n<p>I thought of replacing the links in the Github Repo with the new links I found on Google. It was to help the maintainer and the users of the Repo get access to it.</p>\n<p>I forked the Repo and updated the link in the file, like this:\n<img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634904841190/pualeG1hk.png\" alt=\"Screenshot from 2021-10-22 17-43-44.png\"></p>\n<p>Now, I was ready to submit my first Pull Request. I was unsure whether the Owner and Maintainer would accept it. I even checked their commit history and saw that there had been some delays in merging PRs.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I submitted my first PR &#x26; forgot about it.</p>\n<p>A few days later, I got an email:\n<img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634905102583/5TWn1RWDR.png\" alt=\"Screenshot from 2021-10-22 17-48-09.png\"></p>\n<p>Yes, I was thrilled to see that my Pull Request was merged.\n<img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634905176483/Q37njL72n.png\" alt=\"Screenshot from 2021-10-22 17-49-12.png\"></p>\n<p>It was a turning point for me! This gave me the morale boost to make more contributions. I’m still working on a few.</p>\n<h2>Why you must contribute to Open Source</h2>\n<p>The returns you get from OS Contributions may not be like the typical expectations you have. But, let me assure you that it’ll benefit you in unexpected ways. Here’s a couple of them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You become noticed in the community</li>\n<li>It helps you understand code, better</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To write better code, you need to be able to READ code and understand why someone has taken a specific approach.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading this and I hope this will inspire you to contribute.</p>\n<p>#OpenSource</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"My first Pull Request that was merged and why you must contribute to Open Source","date":"October 21, 2021","description":"You need not be an expert coder to get started with Open Source.
