It also coincided with the Hacktoberfest 2021 (which was in October). I started contributing to Open Source without really intending to. I saw a Repo that had some missing links and just wanted to let the maintainer/owner know the updated one. That was my first OS Contribution</p>\n<p>I have written about it in my first Hashnode article: <a href=\"https://ckvignesh.hashnode.dev/my-first-pull-request-that-was-merged-and-why-you-must-contribute-to-open-source\">My first Pull Request that was merged and why you must contribute to Open Source</a>.</p>\n<p>But, I had to abandon it after 19 days of a continuous coding streak. I did 21 days where the last 2 days were after an interruption.</p>\n<center>\n![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1642821715305/9AmzJFb2g.png)\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1642821919234/KxojSsDxl.png\" alt=\"Git Graph 1.png\"></p>\n</center>\n<p>I was not burned out but, just skipped a couple of days after the 21st day and lost continuity. It was around the same time that my back started aching as I was spending late nights and weekends sitting on my bed, learning to code. That was a bad idea and I refrained from doing that again.</p>\n<p>Though I was not successful in finishing the challenge in that attempt, it helped me customize my <a href=\"https://github.com/ckvignesh\">Github landing page</a> &#x26; build a resume website. I became better at using Git and Markdown.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And the most important part - I rediscovered my passion for programming thanks to supportive communities. I also found a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eduardovedes\">Mentor</a> to help me progress faster.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I can‚Äôt stress the importance of getting a community and a mentor to support and guide you in this process. The learning that happens in a cohort can‚Äôt be replicated in an isolated study environment.</p>\n<p>Now, I had set up a good environment to get into coding &#x26; also got some like-minded people to travel with. The journey had become easier.</p>\n<h2>Learning 0.0</h2>\n<p>As Programmers, we are accustomed to starting things with 0. It‚Äôs theoretically relevant too since I had to restart. So here‚Äôs what I learned during my first attempt. Some of them are documented as blogs:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://ckvignesh.hashnode.dev/github-submodules-and-how-you-can-use-them-for-your-projects\">Github Submodules and how you can use them for your Projects</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ckvignesh.hashnode.dev/configuring-githubs-personal-access-token-to-make-code-pushes-easier\">Configuring Github‚Äôs Personal Access Token to Make Code Pushes Easier</a></li>\n<li>Improved my CSS knowledge by playing some games like <a href=\"https://flexboxfroggy.com/\">Flexbox Froggy</a>, <a href=\"https://codepip.com/games/grid-garden/\">Grid Garden</a> &#x26; <a href=\"http://www.flexboxdefense.com/\">Flex Box Defense</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>New Innings</h2>\n<p>I took some time to re-organize everything after I abandoned my first attempt at the #100DaysofCode. I restarted it in the last week of December 2021. Since there was a gap of more than a month between my first attempt and the second one, I decided to start from 0 rather than continue it from where I left off.</p>\n<p>But, even the 2nd attempt was not easy. I could not code consistently because of too much ‚Äúcontext-switching‚Äù. There were a lot of factors that distracted me. I took care of all that in December &#x26; sorted it out. After that, I took a week‚Äôs break and resumed the #100DaysOfCode challenge.</p>\n<center>\n![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1642822047094/DjoV7YOY6.png)\n*Please don't mind the inconsistency in the `Longest Streak` figures here and above. It was caused by me deleting a Repo I was working on, at that time.*\n</center>\n<h2>Learning 1.0</h2>\n<p>I began to rethink my strategy during the second attempt of #100DaysOfCode. The main intention of the #100DaysofCode challenge was to learn consistently and move ahead to get a developer job. It need not be <code class=\"language-text\">Coding</code> as such, every day. It could be something like reading documentation, books and papers or solving some mathematical problems.</p>\n<p>I read Tiia‚Äôs <a href=\"https://blog.tiia.rocks/making-100daysofcode-work-for-me-with-new-rules\">Making #100DaysOfCode work for me with new rules</a> around that time which had an overlap with my thoughts. There are a few more points in her article and I agree with those since it aligns with the goal of <code class=\"language-text\">getting consistently better at programming</code>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I joined the <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/\">freecodecamp</a> <code class=\"language-text\">2022 Become-a-Dev New Year's Resolution Challenge which overlaps with the #100DaysOfCode Challenge</code>.\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Take the 2022 Become-a-Dev New Year&#39;s Resolution Challenge:<br>üìäMax your stats in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LearnToCodeRPG?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LearnToCodeRPG</a><br>‚å®Ô∏èStart <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysOfCode?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#100DaysOfCode</a><br>üõ¢Ô∏èFinish the fCC Relational Databases Cert<br>üìúPublish 3 tutorials on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashnode?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Hashnode</a><br>To accept: quote-retweet this saying &quot;I&#39;m in.&quot; I&#39;ll add you to my Twitter list. üßµ</p>&mdash; Quincy Larson (@ossia) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ossia/status/1476581551873925123?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 30, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</li>\n<li>Started playing the <code class=\"language-text\">Learn To Code RPG</code> Game (which was a part of the 2022 Become-a-Dev New Year‚Äôs Resolution Challenge).

My first attempts to write it were on Google Docs. It was fine till I wrote about 5000 words. After that, it became difficult to organize and re-order chapters in it.</p>\n<p>Later, I discovered some specific tools for authors. I made some notes after researching about it here: <a href=\"https://ckvignesh.hashnode.dev/writing-tools-for-your-next-book\">Writing Tools For Your Next Book</a>.</p>\n<p>There were some free tools and some paid ones too. I chose <a href=\"https://www.theologeek.ch/manuskript/\">Manuskript</a> to write my book. I also liked <a href=\"https://wavemaker.co.uk/\">Wavemaker</a> and would recommend that too.</p>\n<p>These were just two of the many awesome Free and Open Source Software for writing books on Linux. But, they had their limitations which is when I realized I needed a better solution for my problem. So that‚Äôs when I thought of creating a new tool.</p>\n<p>My goal would be to create a new OS Project that gives writers an awesome interface to write books. It may take years but, it‚Äôll help a lot of writers who may not be able to afford the expensive proprietary software.</p>\n<p>I started a <a href=\"https://github.com/ckvignesh/writingApp\">Repo</a> for it on Github.
