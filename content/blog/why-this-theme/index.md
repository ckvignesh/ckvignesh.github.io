I blog on hashnode ever since I got serious on starting my developer journey. Before that, I used medium, blogger and wordpress.

The reason I moved to hashnode was because I'd get more readers since it had a great developer community.

Ever since I started studying frontend development - HTML, CSS, JS and React, I wanted to make my own blogsite for writing.

Though I'm active on Twitter, my final goal is to get people read my blog content.

So, ever since I started thinking about making my website, I researched on the options I have. Jekyll was one that I knew, since I made my resume website on it. I got to know about Gatsby from our community and decided that I'd use it.

I found this theme on Gatsby's sample themes and also noticed that Dan Abramov uses a slightly modified version of this theme for his blog.

I did not have to think twice to settle down with Gatsby and this theme.
