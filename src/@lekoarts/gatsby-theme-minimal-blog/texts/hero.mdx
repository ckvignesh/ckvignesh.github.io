Frontend Web Developer working with Node.js, Next.js and React to create responsive interfaces for Web Apps. Handled No/Low Code tools like WordPress, Wix and Carrd to build responsive Websites and Landing Pages. <br /> 
Also worked on Documenting ongoing projects, Storyboarding project concepts and testing the deliverables before they're shipped. <br /> 
Outside work, I spend time building products, actively contributing content and code to Open Source Projects.
